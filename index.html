    <p id="para1_abt">My name is <b>Thulani Luyanda Thwala</b>(19) mostly know as <b>Swela</b>
    to many and I am a first year student at the <i>University of the Witwatersrand</i>
    currently pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. I have learned and used several languages and technologies, including CSS, Python, C++, HTML, and JavaScript.
     One important lesson I’ll carry forward is: “Never compare your chapter 1 to someone else’s chapter 20.” We all learn at different paces and bloom in different seasons — your time will come. I grew up in Ladysmith/Mnambithi, where community matters, so I value teamwork and coherence. My family calls me the “technician” because I enjoy helping them with tech issues; their support inspired me to apply for a Computer Science degree.
